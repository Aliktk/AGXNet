 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including cardiac
 enlargement.  There is a persistent pleural effusion on the left, but with
 substantial decrease. Parenchymal opacification involving the left lower lobe
 and probably the lingula persists but similar to improved and not optimally
 assessed with this technique.  The left lung apex, as well as the entirety of

 evidence for pleural effusion on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Reduced pleural effusion on the left without persistent opacification at the
 left lung base, compatible with pneumonia in the appropriate setting. 
 However, even if pneumonia were successfully treated, it might take several
 more weeks for the opacity to clear more definitely.  Atelectasis is also a
 differential diagnosis.  Follow-up radiographs are recommended to show
 clearance within ___ weeks.

 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post right upper lobe resection.  The right

 without change.  Immediately lateral to the right hilum is a new area of
 poorly defined opacity approximately at right eighth posterior rib level.

 effusions have resolved since the prior study.

 New poorly defined right juxta-hilar opacity, possibly due to an early/focal
 pneumonia given clinical suspicion for pneumonia.  However, recurrent
 malignancy is an additional consideration, particularly considering adjacent
 persistent enlargement and increased density of the right hilum.  
 
 Management recommendation for this finding is treatment for pneumonia with
 short-term followup radiographs. However, as there is reportedly also a
 potential clinical concern for aortic dissection, an immediate chest CTA
 should be considered as a CXR is not sufficiently sensitive or specific for
 detecting or excluding this diagnosis.

 atelectasis or pneumonia.  Atelectasis at the left lung base remains quite

 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube which projects over the
 trachea and appears to enter the left mainstem bronchus in course inferiorly,
 presumably penetrating the diaphragm and with distal tip projecting over the
 mid left abdomen. There is a large left pneumothorax with rightward shift of
 mediastinal structures. There is stable position of right-sided port with
 distal tip projecting over cavoatrial junction.
 
 Allowing for changes due to mediastinal shift, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged. The bilateral hila are not well visualized.
 
 The left lung is collapsed against the left mediastinum secondary to large
 pneumothorax. The right lung is clear without evidence of focal consolidation.
 There is no right pneumothorax. There are no pleural effusions.

 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with obstructive jaundice and duodenal perforation
 during ERCP.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs, at 9:20 a.m., a
 following series of chest radiographs as late as 8:09 a.m. on ___:
 
 By the time this chest radiograph was officially interpreted by the staff
 radiologist, at 9:20 a.m., there was subsequent radiographic documentation of
 partial treatment of bilateral pneumothorax. The findings on this chest
 radiograph were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ Dr. ___, ___ the
 telephone at 9:50 and 9:55 p.m., respectively.
 
 Large bilateral pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, and
 extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and less so right chest wall
 attributable to duodenal perforation.  Since the pneumothorax is bilateral,
 there is less likelihood of mediastinal shift from hemodynamically significant
 positive pleural pressure.  Similarly, although the diaphragm is not
 depressed, there is probably pneumoperitoneum or at least
 pneumoretroperitoneum which could temper the effects of even hemodynamically
 significant elevation of transpleural pressure.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings and subsequent course of partial
 treatment of the pneumothoraces at 9:30 a.m. on ___, including my concern
 that at least the right pleural drain is substantially if not entirely
 extrathoracic, and that the location of the left pleural drain is dubious as
 well given the failure to evacuate the moderate left pneumothorax after
 improvement with initial placement.

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Volume of right pleural fluid has decreased substantially, basal pigtail
 pleural drainage catheter still in place.  Right apical pneumothorax is barely
 visible.  Consolidation remaining at the base of the right lung could be
 atelectasis or pneumonia.  Atelectasis at the left lung base remains quite

 presence of any pericardial effusion is radiographically indeterminate.  There
 may be mild perihilar edema, but this is difficult to diagnose in the setting
 of effusions.

 into the upper stomach and out of view. No left pneumothorax.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pigtail placed for right pneumothorax, likely
 malpositioned in the liver.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been interval placement of a right-sided catheter with pigtail
 projecting over the liver.  A persistent moderate size right pneumothorax
 remains with continued leftward shift of mediastinal structures as seen on the
 chest CT scout.  Increased subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral chest
 wall is noted.  Streaky opacities are noted in the right lung likely
 reflective of atelectasis.  Low lung volumes are present which results in
 crowding of bronchovascular structures and left basilar atelectasis.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal contours otherwise remain unchanged.  Right lateral rib
 fractures are better assessed on the previous CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of right-sided catheter with pigtail projecting over the
 liver.  Persistent moderate size right pneumothorax with continued mild
 leftward shift of mediastinal structures.  Patchy atelectasis in both lungs. 
 Increased subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral chest wall.
